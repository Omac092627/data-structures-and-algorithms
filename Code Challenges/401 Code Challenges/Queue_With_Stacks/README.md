# Queues with stacks
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Perform two actions with enqueue and dequeue. One will take in three numbers and push them to the end of the queue. 
The other will pop off the end of the queue until it reaches the last element.



## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Can successfully enqueue into a queue
Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value



## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took the approach of buildingn out the methods first. I wanted to understand the methods I am dealing with.

Next I implemented unit testing to assure the methods were concise. 

Finally, I check my unit tests against my methods. Did not pass.

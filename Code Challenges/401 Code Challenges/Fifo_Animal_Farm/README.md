# Fifo-Animal-Shelter
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.

enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Can successfully enqueue animal into a queue
Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value



## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took the approach of buildingn out the methods first. I wanted to understand the methods I am dealing with.

Next I implemented unit testing to assure the methods were concise. 

Finally, I check my unit tests against my methods. Did not pass.

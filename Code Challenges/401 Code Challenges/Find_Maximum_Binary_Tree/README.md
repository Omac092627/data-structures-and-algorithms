# Find-Maximum-Binary-Tree
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Write an instance method called find-maximum-value.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. 
You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.



## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Can successfully returns the max value in a binary tree 
If the node is null then return the minimum value
If the rightchild is greater than result, than the result is equal to the right child




## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took the approach of building out the Node class first. I wanted to understand the properties I am dealing with.

Next I implemented unit testing to assure the methods were concise. 

Finally, I check my unit tests against my methods. Did not pass.

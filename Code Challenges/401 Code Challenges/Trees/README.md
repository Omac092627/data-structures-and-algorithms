# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
Create a BinaryTree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.



## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Can successfully preOrder
Can successfully inOrder
Can successfully postOrder
Can successfully unit test all the above.



## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took the approach of buildingn out the classes first. I wanted to understand the classes I am dealing with.

Next I implemented unit testing to assure the methods were concise. 

Finally, I check my unit tests against my methods. Did not pass.

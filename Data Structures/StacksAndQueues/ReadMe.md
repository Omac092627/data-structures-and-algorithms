# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This application is meant to implement the stack and queue. I implemented a Pop method, a IsEmpty method, and a Push method. These methods are 
meant to manipulate the stack. Essentially a faux version of queries and call stack methods.



## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Can successfully push onto a stack
Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
Can successfully pop off the stack
Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception
Can successfully enqueue into a queue
Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took the approach of buildingn out the methods first. I wanted to understand the methods I am dealing with.

Next I implemented unit testing to assure the methods were concise. 

Finally, I check my unit tests against my methods. 



## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
Push method to push onto the stack.
Pop method to remove from the stack.
IsEmpty method in order to set my Top node to null if empty.

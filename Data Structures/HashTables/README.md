# Hash Tables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.

Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:
add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Can successfully add to hash.
Can successfully get from hash
Can successfully check to see what hash index contains
Can successfully can hash
Can successfully Adding a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure
Can successfully Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored
Can successfully Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable
Can successfully Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable
Can successfully Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value



## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took the approach of buildingn out the unit testing first. I wanted to understand the methods I am dealing with.

Next I implemented methods to assure the testing was concise. 

Finally, I check my unit tests against my methods.

1. Add()
2. Get()
3. Contains()

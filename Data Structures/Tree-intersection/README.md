# Tree Intersection
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->



## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
O(n) - find common elements
O(m * h) - Time complexity of this solution where me is number of nodes in first tree and h is height of second tree.

## Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
